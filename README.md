I recently designed and implemented a full enterprise network for a 3-floor hotel using Cisco Packet Tracer as part of my networking practice after completing my CCNA preparation.

🔹 Project Highlights:

Designed a 3-router topology interconnected via Serial DCE links

Implemented OSPF routing protocol for dynamic route advertisement

Configured 9 VLANs across 3 floors (IT, Admin, HR, Finance, Sales, Reception, Store, Logistics)

Implemented Inter-VLAN routing

Configured DHCP on routers for automatic IP assignment

Deployed WiFi networks on each floor

Configured SSH for secure remote access

Implemented Port Security (Sticky MAC + Shutdown mode) on IT switch

Ensured full inter-department communication across the network

This project strengthened my skills in:
✔ Routing & Switching
✔ OSPF Configuration
✔ VLAN & Trunking
✔ DHCP Configuration
✔ Network Security (Port Security & SSH)
✔ Enterprise Network Design

I’m continuously building real-world networking projects to sharpen my skills and prepare for enterprise environments.
